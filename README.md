<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

Dynamic programming has the reputation for being tricky to master, but once you understand the basic concepts and practice them enough, the algorithms do not seem so difficult anymore.

My hope is that this lightweight course will serve as a primer for students to prepare for other, more rigorous algorithm courses at university.

<h3 id="audience">Who is this course for?</h3>

This course requires the level of computer science knowledge of a first year, first degree student.
Some knowledge of Python is necessary to complete the coding exercises.

This course is designed to be taken over a few hours, for example as a weekend project. The 

<h3 id="usage">How to run and view this course</h2>

To see all the notebooks click on this [link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/rachelyeshurun/magic-of-dynamic-programming/master?urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Fnotebooks)

Alternatively, navigage to each notebook from the table of contents above. When you click on a notebook link, a fully interactive classroom session will launch within 30 seconds in your browser _without any setup_ or installation!

Note: The session might take some time to open, or it might not build on your first try. Be patient or try clicking the link again.

The notebooks have short embedded videos to start off each new topic.  Watch the video, read the explanation and test your understanding with some quick quizzes.<br> Follow along with a worked example, then try your hand at the coding exercises. In these problem sets you will get a chance to apply the techniques learned up to that point. Try to work the problems out on your own before peeking at the answers :wink:

The notebooks should be __viewed in order!!__ The lessons build on each other, so skipping around is not recommended.

<h5 id="setup">Once you are in the notebooks:</h5>

When the notebooks load, most elements such as videos, text and diagrams will be visible.
The interactive quizzes don't always show up, you'll have to run the notebook to view them.
    
See this gif for how to run the whole notebook at once

If running the whole notebook doesn't show the quizzes, you can run cells individually as in the following gif.

<h2 id="behind">Behind the Scenes</h2>
This course was born as a final project for the course [CS6460 Education Technologoy](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6460-educational-technology) taken during my Master's degree in Computer Science.

Aside from the obligation to give credit where it's due, the following links may be of interest to the reader.

<h4 id="pedagogy">Lesson Plans</h4>

This course is an implementation of the article 'Towards a Better Way to Teach Dynamic Programming' (Fori≈°ek, 2015).<br>
The notebooks follow the 8 lesson plans described in the article, expanding the lesson outlines with additional explanations and original content.

<h4 id="inspiration">Other great notebooks</h4>
In developing this course I was inspired by many other educational projects

The following notebooks stand out as the ones I most relied upon for inspiration:

The organization of this readme is <s>copied</s>, inspired by my Georgia Tech classmate [Yogesh Pandey's](https://github.com/yogeshmpandey/M4DT) course [Mathematics for Digital Technologies in Python](https://github.com/yogeshmpandey/M4DT) which incidentally, makes an excellent companion course for this one if you're using these notebooks to prepare for a deeper dive in to machine learning, computer vision, NLP etc.

This [question and the answer](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/issues/2487) by Xiang Zhai formed the base for the quiz infrastructure
